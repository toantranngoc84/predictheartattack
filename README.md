# Heart Attack Prediction


## Overview

A heart attack, also known as myocardial infarction, is a medical emergency where the heart muscle begins to die because it isnâ€™t receiving enough blood flow. This is typically caused by blockages in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Without prompt medical intervention to restore blood flow, a heart attack can lead to permanent damage or death.

This Streamlit-based application provides crucial information about heart attacks and offers a predictive tool using a machine learning model to assess the risk of heart attacks based on user inputs.


## Features

### 1. **Informational Content**
The app includes detailed educational content on heart attacks:
- **What is a Heart Attack?**
- **Signs and Symptoms**
- **What Causes a Heart Attack?**
- **Risk Factors**
- **Prevention**
- **Statistics**
- **Further Information** (Helpful websites, research papers, etc.)

### 2. **Heart Attack Prediction Tool**
The app allows users to input clinical parameters to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using a trained machine learning model. Input parameters include:
- Gender
- Age
- Heart Rate
- Blood Sugar Level
- Systolic Blood Pressure
- Diastolic Blood Pressure
- CK-MB (Creatine Kinase-MB) Level
- Troponin Level

The model then provides a prediction of the likelihood of a heart attack based on these inputs.


## Dataset

The dataset used to train the predictive model is sourced from [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wmhctcrt5v/1).


## Machine Learning Approach

The heart attack prediction model was built using Python, employing various machine learning techniques:

- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Used to handle class imbalance in the dataset.
- **StandardScaler**: Applied for feature normalization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model performance through techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Cross-Validation**: Used to evaluate model performance with K-Fold cross-validation.
- **Feature Selection**: Multiple feature selection techniques were employed.
- **Model Selection**: Several classification models were explored, including boosting models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The best-performing model is deployed in the app.


## How to Use the App
